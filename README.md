Market Share Growth Strategy for Consumer Credit Cards
Project Background
As a career returner transitioning into data analytics, I wanted to learn how real businesses use data to solve practical problems. Instead of only practicing isolated Excel or Python exercises, I decided to apply my learning to a realistic business scenario in the financial services industry.

The U.S. consumer credit card market is extremely competitive. Banks compete not only to acquire new customers, but also to ensure their cards are actively used for daily spending such as groceries, dining, travel, and online shopping. Many customers today own multiple credit cards, and they choose different cards for different types of spending based on rewards, convenience, and offers.

In this beginner-friendly simulation project, I worked on a simplified version of a real-world business case inspired by how teams like Visa Consulting & Analytics (VCA) help banks grow their credit card business using data.
